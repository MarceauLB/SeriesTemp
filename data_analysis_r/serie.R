# Question 1: Data Preprocessing
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

# We start by displaying every available time series
names(GOOGL) = c("open","high","low","close","volume","adjusted")

any(is.na(GOOGL)) # no missing value in the time series

global_google_ts = ts(GOOGL)

# Except the volume time series, all the other time series exhibit the same general trend.

# Question 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Focus on Opening Prices

# The time series has a wigglier trend when time increases. This means that the variance increases over time 
# so we will consider a log-transformation to make the variance constant.
log_ts <- log(ts_serie)
plot(log_ts, main = "Log-transformed time series")

# The ACF decreases slowly, suggesting a non-stationarity for the time series.

# Augmented Dickey-Fuller test:
adf.test(log_ts)
# H0 : non-stationary series (existence of a unit root) 
# H1 : stationary series 
# p-value is 0.057 : we cannot reject H0 (with confidence level 5%). 
# The series is not stationary

# We difference it 
serie_diff <- diff(log_ts)

# p-value = 0.01. The time series seems stationary.

dev.off()
# The ACF decreases quickly this time, which suggests once again that
# stationarity has been reached.
